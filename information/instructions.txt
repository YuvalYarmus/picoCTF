Whenever I get an image file:
I go and run file (to make sure it's an image),
binwalk (to see if there are hidden files),
strings and usually I pair that with grep and lastly I check the image in a hexeditor, just to check the header and such.

to dump the hex into a file:
xxd file > hex_dump_of_file.txt
or:
hexdump -C [file]

we can also try:
Using exiftool to look at the exif data of the image in our terminal we see some interesting data under "License".
i.e exiftool cat.jpg


to decode the license from base64 we can use:
echo "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9" | base64 --decode
or just: echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d




in case you go for the hex solution notice the base64 will be here:
<cc:license r  df:resource='cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9'/>
