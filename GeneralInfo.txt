 Whenever I get an image file (or almost any file really):
I go and run file (to make sure it's an image), i.e: file [file]
binwalk (to see if there are hidden files), if there are hidden files use: binwalk -D='.*' [file], or: binwalk -e -M dolls.jpg to do it recursively
strings and usually I pair that with grep and lastly I check the image in a hexeditor, just to check the header and such,
using exiftool to look at the exif data of the image in our terminal: i.e exiftool cat.jpg

to dump the hex into a file:
xxd file > hex_dump_of_file.txt
or:
hexdump -C [file]

to decode the license from base64 we can use:
echo "cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9" | base64 --decode
or just: echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d



x << y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros).
This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.

x >> y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. 
This is the same as dividing x by 2**y.

***  the shifts aren't circular: if y>log2(x) --> x >> y = 0

the pwn library allows one to use nc in a script, recieve lines and send lines.

The %x allows us to traverse up a stack in C.


linux bash:
The >> appends to a file or creates the file if it doesn't exist.
