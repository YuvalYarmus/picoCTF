chmod +x on a file (your script) only means, that you'll make it executable. 
Right click on your script and chose Properties -> Permissions -> Allow executing file as program, leaves you with the exact same result as the command in terminal.

If a file you want to change permissions on is located within the systems directory you may need to be root, like so: (be careful, while using sudo command)

sudo chmod +x /usr/share/testfolder/aFile 

Also it is not clear, what exactly you want to archive here. Please edit your question and give some more detail on the actual problem!

You can also refer to this question, for more information: chmod u+x' versus 'chmod +x



// Change the permissions of a file for all users via Mac terminal

// CD into the exe folder where your file is stored and run:
chmod a+x example.txt 

// chmod: change mode (permissions) of a file.
// a+x: for all (a) users, add (+) the execute (x) permission.
